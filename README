This is the SciPAL readme file.

In order to use SciPAL you need the following dependencies:

• deal.II (www.dealii.org), see additional information in their tar-archive. 
  Runnig deal.II's cmake-file should give you a working installation

• CUDA-Toolkit (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). For further 
  information have a look in NVidia's getting started guide (also on link).

If you have these installed, put SciPAL in your preferred folder and run the 
installaton script install.py from /scripts/. This will set the paths of the CUDA
and deal.II installation. 

Note: The installation script configures only for a basic deal.II installation.
      If you have a deal.II installation using MPI, petsc, etc. you can use the
      advanced configuration file from /config/dealii_mpi_conf.pro as template 
      for your configuration.
