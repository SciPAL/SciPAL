# we don't let doxygen put everything into a namespace
# dealii. consequently, doxygen can't link references that contain an
# explicit dealii:: qualification. remove it and replace it by the
# global scope

# Now, as of doxygen 1.5, this still produces the wrong result, but
# that's not our fault. This is reported here:
