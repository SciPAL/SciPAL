# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
subsection CUDA parameters
  # which CUDA-enabled GPU should be used
  set Device        = 0

  # Whether shared (true) or L1 (false) memory should be used.
  set Shared Memory = true
end


subsection Simulation basics
  # Specify a directory where results of the test are to be stored. This can
  # be either an absolute path or path relative to the directory where the
  # program has been started. The default is subdir called test_me-<date>
  # where <date> will be replaced by the date at which the program has been
  # started. this simplifies keeping the projects directory clean
  set Run directory = ./test_me
end


subsection Testcase parameters
  # Number of runs being used for averaging
  set Average - runs            = 10

  # Decide between double (true) or float (false) precision
  set Double-Precision          = true

  # Decide whether to execute an LU decomposition. This implies a square
  # testcase matrix.
  set LU decomposition          = false

  # Start value of the range of matrix sizes tested by the simulation
  set Matrix size - lower limit = 256

  # Increment for the size of the test matrices
  set Matrix size - step size   = 1024

  # End value of the range of matrix sizes tested by the simulation
  set Matrix size - upper limit = 513
end
