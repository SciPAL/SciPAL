# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
subsection Device flags
  # This allows to dedicate the local L1 caches completely to buffering
  # register spilling effects.
  set Disable L1 caching for global memory = false

  # This allows to rather use 48 KB as L1 cache.
  set Maximize L1 cache                    = false

  # This allows to access the matrix via texture and not by direct memory
  # accesses. On older hardware textures can exploit the 2D locality of matrix
  # entries. On Fermi- or Kepler-based GPUs this should not make much sense.
  set Wrap matrix into texture             = true
end


subsection Dimensions of test problems.
  # Binary logarithm of minimal number of columns of upper triangular matrix
  # R. Allowed range : [3,16]
  set log2(max n cols)   = 13.001  # default: 12

  # Binary logarithm of minimal number of columns of upper triangular matrix
  # R. Allowed range : [2,15]
  set log2(min n cols)   = 3       # default: 4

  # Perform the test for this many randomly chosen matrix sizes.If the value
  # given is 0, then a list of matrix sizes is used which is generated
  # deterministically from the growth strategy.
  set n random trials    = 0

  # Repeat the test for a given matrix size this many times.
  set n repetitions      = 20      # default: 1

  # In each test instance the number of rows of R is increased by this factor.
  # Allowed range : [1.1,10]
  set n rows growth rate = 1.12517 # default: 1.4
end


subsection Fujimoto parameters
  # In case of float the <generic> version is a verbatim copy of the original
  # version. In case of double the reading of the matrix induces 50% idle
  # threads. <no bitshift> is identical to the generic version  except that
  # index arithmetic is done in a more human readable fashion. <double
  # optimization> provides optimized access to the matrix entries in the case
  # of double precision.
  set Fujimoto variant = original # default: generic
end


subsection Global parameters
  # CPU-BLAS and CUBLAS double.
  set Run CPU-BLAS vs CUBLAS double   = false # default: true

  # CPU-BLAS and CUBLAS float.
  set Run CPU-BLAS vs CUBLAS float    = false # default: true

  # CPU-BLAS and Fujimoto double.
  set Run CPU-BLAS vs Fujimoto double = false

  # CPU-BLAS and Fujimoto float.
  set Run CPU-BLAS vs Fujimoto float  = false # default: true

  # Fujimoto vs CUBLAS double.
  set Run Fujimoto vs CUBLAS double   = false

  # Fujimoto vs CUBLAS float.
  set Run Fujimoto vs CUBLAS float    = true
end


subsection Simulation basics
  # Specify a directory results of the test are to be stored. This can be
  # either an absolute path or path relative to the directory where the
  # program has been started. The default is subdir called test_me-<date>
  # where <date> will be replaced by the date at which the program has been
  # started. this simplifies keeping the projects directory clean
  set Run directory = ../step-2/reference-results/Thu-25-04-2013-FJ-orig-vs-CUBLAS-float-max_8192x8192 # default: ./test_me
