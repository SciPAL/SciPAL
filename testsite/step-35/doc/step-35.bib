	abstract ={Super-resolution optical microscopy is a rapidly evolving area of fluorescence microscopy with a tremendous potential for
		impacting many fields of science. Several super-resolution methods have been developed over the last decade, all capable of
			overcoming the fundamental diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining subdiffraction
			limit optical resolution in all three dimensions. This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of
			temporal fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded in a sequence of images (movie). We
			demonstrate a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope. This
			resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps, which in turn allows the evaluation of images at
			different resolution levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method features significant
			background reduction and thus contrast enhancement and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of
			fibroblast cells.},

  abstract={Resolution in optical nanoscopy (or super-resolution microscopy) depends on the localization uncertainty and density of single fluorescent labels and on the sample's spatial structure. Currently there is no integral, practical resolution measure that accounts for all factors. We introduce a measure based on Fourier ring correlation (FRC) that can be computed directly from an image. We demonstrate its validity and benefits on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D localization microscopy images of tubulin and actin filaments. Our FRC resolution method makes it possible to compare achieved resolutions in images taken with different nanoscopy methods, to optimize and rank different emitter localization and labeling strategies, to define a stopping criterion for data acquisition, to describe image anisotropy and heterogeneity, and even to estimate the average number of localizations per emitter. Our findings challenge the current focus on obtaining the best localization precision, showing instead how the best image resolution can be achieved as fast as possible.},
