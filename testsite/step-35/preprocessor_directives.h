//@sect4{Preprocessor directives}
//Should we use double or single precision? \n
//Double precision is only supported for the exact Dykstra method,
//not for the approximative Dykstra method \n
//If DOUBLE_PRECISION is not defined we use floats

//#define DOUBLE_PRECISION


//If defined, print total dykstra kernel execution time to "kernel_time" for speedup plots \n

//#define TIME_KERNELS
