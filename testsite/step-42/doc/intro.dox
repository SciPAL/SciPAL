<h1>Introduction</h1>
This tutorial program illustrates the capabilities of SciPal's DSEL.
We show the evaluation of differnt expressions corresponding to the different (cu)BLAS levels.
The tests are implemented in cuda_driver_step-42.hh.
The perallelization strategy can be choosen by changing the template parameter BW in cuda_driver_step-42.h.
